# Day 3 Entry

Today we learned about creating list with ordered and unordered list items. Using CSS selectors will allow you the style the parent and child sub code of your elements. 

# Day 4 

Pair progamming assignment went well. Its a good practice to work with other people to see how their thought process is when coding.
