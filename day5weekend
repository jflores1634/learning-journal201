# Day 5 and Weekend Entry

Today I learned more about working on branching and making pull request from and to myself. We also had a partner power hour. The guest speaker was Donte Parks from Substantial. 
Over the weekend I will be working on more of my About Me assignment as well as working on the testing assignment that will help us get used to creating branches.
